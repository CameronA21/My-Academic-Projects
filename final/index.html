           <h1>Our Group Mission:</h1>
           
           <p>Headies and Threadies was created by a group of friends who came together 
             to sell clothes. We started Headies and Threadies because of our own personal 
             experiences. We want to create a safe relaible space for people to buy and sell
             clothes. Currently, our main clothing items are vintage clothing and collectables. 
             But, as we evolve as a company, the variety of clothing items will only grow. Overall
             we will provide a site to check our stock, an in store location, and a way for users
             to sell their own clothes.     </p>
