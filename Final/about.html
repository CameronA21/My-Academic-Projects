         <h1><strong>Who are we?</strong></h1>
         
         <p class="about">Threadies and Headies was started when a group of friends found an
            interest in buying clothes. This <mark>passion</mark> evolved when we started going to 
            the goodwill bins. From this, we realized we could make a profit from the 
            clothes obtained from the bins. This lit the fire for our passion of clothes. From
            there we kept expanding our stock as much as possible until we became the 
            group we are today. We have had our hiccups along the way, but nothing has stoped us
            from creating a safe place to buy and sell clothes.        </p>

         <h1><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h1>
         
         <p class="about">We started out going to a place called the bins where you can get a large amount of clothes for a lower price than normal.
            But, most if not all of the clothes we gathered from the bins was vintage.
         With this said, the clothing items would sell for more than your average clothing item.
		 This allowed us to slowly increase our stock until we became the company you see today. </p>

         <h1><strong>Why do we do this?</strong></h1>
         
         <p class="about">Like many others, we have had negative experiences with clothing websites/ companies.
            After this, we decided to create a <em>completely safe and easy way to buy and sell clothes</em>.
            Our group understands the passion that can come from clothing and we want to share that passion with everyone.         </p>
